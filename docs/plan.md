# Project Enhancement Plan

## Completed Items ‚úÖ

### 1. Core-Gateway Integration

- [x] Test complete API key flow:
  - [x] Generate API key via Gateway
  - [x] Verify key storage in S3
  - [x] Test Core's ability to use the key
  - [x] Verify rate limiting through Core
  - [x] Test key expiration through Core
  - [x] Test API key purge functionality

### 2. Integration Testing

- [x] Test end-to-end flow:
  - [x] Core startup and ngrok URL registration
  - [x] Gateway's dynamic URL updates
  - [x] File structure retrieval through Core
  - [x] File content access through Core
  - [x] Full production test with cleanup

### 3. Essential Documentation

- [x] Update main README with:
  - [x] Correct architecture overview (Core + Gateway)
  - [x] Accurate setup instructions
  - [x] API key acquisition process
  - [x] API key management instructions

### 4. Security Enhancements

- [x] Implement API key purge endpoint
- [x] Add audit logging for key operations
- [x] Implement secure key storage in S3

## Current Priority (Next Sprint)

### 1. Security Enhancements

- [ ] Review and tighten KMS key policy
- [ ] Consider using AWS Secrets Manager for API key storage
- [ ] Implement key rotation mechanism

### 2. Infrastructure Improvements

- [ ] Add automated version management
- [ ] Add environment configurations (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Implement backup strategy for S3 objects
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting for security events

### 3. Development Experience

- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for code formatting
- [ ] Enhance Makefile with additional targets:
  - [x] `make init`: Setup development environment
  - [ ] `make deploy`: Deploy to EC2
  - [ ] `make api-keys`: Manage API keys
- [ ] Add colored output for better visibility

## Known Issues üêõ

- Fixed: URL decoding issue resolved in Gateway API

## Future Improvements (Post-Sprint)

### Phase 1: Core Enhancements

- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed files
- [ ] Improve error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Enhance request logging

### Phase 2: Gateway Enhancements

- [ ] Implement soft delete for API keys
- [ ] Add disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Create runbooks for common operations

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- [ ] Develop management interface
- [ ] Add automated security scanning
- [ ] Implement advanced monitoring
- [ ] Add architecture diagrams
