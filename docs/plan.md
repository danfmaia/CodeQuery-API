# Project Enhancement Plan

## 1. Quick Start Experience (High Priority)

### API Key Management

- [x] Implement secure API key generation endpoint in Gateway
- [x] Add S3-based encrypted storage for API keys
- [ ] Add rate limiting to protect the service
- [ ] Implement key expiration for better security
- [ ] Add key usage tracking (last used, request count)

### Documentation

- [ ] Enhance Quick Start section in README
  - [ ] Add clear step-by-step instructions
  - [ ] Include example responses for each endpoint
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting tips
- [ ] Create a Postman collection for easy API testing
- [ ] Add usage examples with popular AI platforms

### Visual Documentation

- [ ] Add architecture diagram
- [ ] Include screenshots of key features
- [ ] Create demo GIFs showing:
  - [ ] Project structure retrieval
  - [ ] File content access
  - [ ] Integration with AI assistants

## 2. Core Features (Medium Priority)

### Performance & Reliability

- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed files
- [ ] Implement request queueing for large file operations
- [ ] Add retry logic for cloud operations

### Security Enhancements

- [ ] Add request logging for audit trails
- [ ] Implement IP-based rate limiting
- [ ] Add automated security scanning

## 3. Optional Improvements (Low Priority)

### Management Interface
