## Introduction

**CodeQueryâ„¢ API** is a lightweight and efficient Python/Flask tool designed to enable AI assistantsâ€”such as custom GPTsâ€”to navigate and interact with local code. With this API, [LLM agents](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/agents/) can query project structures and retrieve file contents, helping developers explore and manage large codebases. By adhering to customizable ignore patterns, the API ensures that only relevant files are accessed, making it an invaluable tool for AI-driven code analysis and development.

ðŸ¤– **Curious Fact**: During its development, the **CodeQuery API** was an integral part of its own creation process, being used to analyze, write, and debug its own files while the project evolved. This unique feedback loop made it a participant in its own development stages! For more details on how the CodeQuery API has been applied, see the [Cases](#cases) section.

## Features

- **Designed for AI Assistants**: This API was specifically designed to integrate with AI assistants such as custom GPTs, providing them with efficient access to project file structures and contents.
- **Retrieve Project Structure**: Get a detailed view of the projectâ€™s directories and files.
- **Retrieve File Contents**: Access the contents of specific files in the project, with error handling for non-existent paths.
- **Custom Ignore Patterns**: Utilize `.agentignore` and/or `.gitignore` for specifying which files or directories to exclude from the structure retrieval.

## API Endpoints

### 1. **Retrieve Project Structure**

- **Endpoint**: `/files/structure`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Retrieves the directory structure of the project, respecting the ignore patterns in `.agentignore`. This is useful for tools that need to understand the file organization, such as code editors or static analysis tools.

- **Response Example**:

  ```json
  {
    ".": {
      "directories": ["backend", "frontend", "config"],
      "files": [".env", "README.md"]
    },
    "backend": {
      "directories": ["controllers", "models", "services"],
      "files": ["app.py", "database.py"]
    },
    "frontend": {
      "directories": ["components", "pages"],
      "files": ["index.html", "app.js"]
    },
    "config": {
      "directories": [],
      "files": ["settings.yaml", "logging.conf"]
    }
  }
  ```

- **Error Scenarios**:

  - **500 Internal Server Error**: If thereâ€™s a failure in reading the directory structure, such as permission issues or corrupted files, an internal error response will be returned.

  **Example Error Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Failed to retrieve directory structure: [Detailed error message]"
  }
  ```

### 2. **Retrieve File Contents**

- **Endpoint**: `/files/content`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Retrieves the content of specified files. Useful for directly accessing specific source files or configuration files.

- **Request Body**:

  ```json
  {
    "file_paths": ["backend/app.py", "frontend/app.js"]
  }
  ```

- **Response Example**:

  ```json
  {
    "backend/app.py": {
      "content": "# Main application file\nfrom flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    return 'Hello, World!'"
    },
    "frontend/app.js": {
      "content": "// Frontend application logic\nimport React from 'react';\nfunction App() {\n    return (<div>Hello, World!</div>);\n}"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Error Scenarios**:

  - **400 Bad Request**: If no file paths are provided in the request body.

  **Example Error Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "error": "No file paths provided in the request."
  }
  ```

  - **404 Not Found**: If all the requested file paths do not exist or are missing.

  **Example Error Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "error": "All requested files are missing"
  }
  ```

  - **422 Unprocessable Entity**: If a directory is specified instead of a file.

  **Example Error Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "frontend/components": {
      "error": "Cannot read directory: frontend/components"
    }
  }
  ```

  - **500 Internal Server Error**: If thereâ€™s a failure in reading a file due to permissions, encoding issues, or other OS-level errors.

  **Example Error Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "backend/app.py": {
      "error": "Error reading file: [Detailed error message]"
    }
  }
  ```

## .agentignore File

The `.agentignore` file works similarly to `.gitignore`, allowing you to specify files and directories that should be excluded from file structure queries (`/files/structure` endpoint).

**Example**:

```plaintext
# General
.git/
.gitignore
.vscode/
assets/
public/

# Python
src/__pycache__/
tests/__pycache__/
__pycache__/
venv/
.benchmarks/
.pytest_cache/
.env
requirements.txt

# JavaScript
node_modules/
package-lock.json
package.json
```

## Environment Variables

The **CodeQuery API** relies on environment variables, defined in an `.env` file located in the root directory, to configure its behavior. Follow these steps to set up the environment variables correctly:

1. **Locate `template.env`**: After cloning the repository, find the `template.env` file in the root directory. This file serves as a template for the necessary environment variables.

2. **Rename `template.env` to `.env`**: Before customizing the variables, rename the file:

   ```bash
   mv template.env .env
   ```

3. **Customize the Variables**: Adjust the variables in the `.env` file according to your projectâ€™s requirements:

   ```plaintext
   # Project Settings
   PROJECT_PATH="../my-project"                  # Set this to the root path of your project
   AGENTIGNORE_FILES=".agentignore,.gitignore"   # Specify custom ignore patterns for file structure queries

   # API Integration
   API_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"    # Your personal API key (if applicable)
   GATEWAY_BASE_URL="https://codequery.dev"      # Set to your Gateway's public URL (if applicable)
   NGROK_AUTHTOKEN="YOUR_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN"        # Your ngrok authtoken for v3.x

   # Other
   LOCAL_PORT=5001                               # Port number for running the Core component locally
   TIMEOUT=10                                    # Request timeout in seconds
   ```

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose (optional)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danfmaia/CodeQuery-API.git
   cd CodeQuery-API
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t codequery_core .
   ```

3. **Set up the environment variables**:

   Refer to the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for a complete guide on setting and customizing variables. Key variables to review include:

   - `PROJECT_PATH`
   - `API_KEY`
   - `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN`

4. **Run the container**:

   - Use Docker to start the container:

     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 5001:5001 -p 4040:4040 --name codequery_core --env-file .env codequery_core
     ```

   - This command will run the CodeQuery Core component and expose it on port 5001. Ngrokâ€™s local API will be accessible on port 4040 for tunnel management.

### Testing the API

Once the container is running, you can test the API by sending requests to the exposed endpoints.

- **Retrieve Project Structure**:

  ```bash
  curl -H "X-API-KEY: $API_KEY" http://127.0.0.1:5001/files/structure
  ```

- **Retrieve File Contents**:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-API-KEY: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"file_paths": ["core/run.py", "core/src/ngrok_manager.py"]}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:5001/files/content
  ```

For extensive testing, refer to the [Testing Guide](docs/testing.md).

### Other Exposure Options

#### 1. **Using a Paid Ngrok URL**

- **Description**: If you have a paid ngrok plan, set up a permanent public URL by running the Core component locally and using the ngrok URL for external access.

- **Command**:

  ```bash
  python run_local.py
  ```

- **Use Case**: Suitable for users who require a consistent external URL and prefer a simple setup.

#### 2. **Setting Up a Self-Hosted Server**

- **Description**: For users with a static IP or home server, you can host the Core directly using your ISPâ€™s services, avoiding ngrok or Gateway usage.

- **Command**:

  ```bash
  python run_local.py
  ```

- **Steps**:

  1. **Check Static IP Availability**: Ensure your ISP offers a static IP.
  2. **Port Forwarding**: Configure your router to forward traffic on port 5001 to the local machine.
  3. **Domain Setup**: Consider using a custom domain for access.
  4. **SSL/TLS Configuration**: Use services like Let's Encrypt to secure the server.

## Cases

### 1. CoreQuery API (and CodeQueryGPT)

The **CoreQuery API** itself is the first use case of the CodeQuery API, and itâ€™s the project youâ€™re currently exploring. It serves as a powerful development tool, integrating with AI assistants (such as the [**CodeQueryGPT**](#codequerygpt--creating-your-own-custom-gpt-for-using-this-api)) to support developers by providing a structured way to query project files, understand code dependencies, and interact with large codebases. This project was developed using a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach to ensure the correctness of the AI-generated code.

### 2. SkillChrono

[SkillChrono](https://github.com/danfmaia/SkillChrono) is a Python-based tool designed to help developers organize and visualize their technical skills across various projects. It processes structured data, aggregates experience per technology, and generates markdown reports sorted both alphabetically and by experience duration. SkillChrono was also built using a **TDD** approach, and the **CodeQuery API** was integral to its development, supporting everything from feature implementation to documentation generation.

For more details, see the [SkillChrono repository](https://github.com/danfmaia/SkillChrono).
