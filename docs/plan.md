# Project Enhancement Plan

## Immediate Priority (3-Hour Timeline)

### 1. Verify Core-Gateway Integration

- [ ] Test complete API key flow:
  - [ ] Generate API key via Gateway
  - [ ] Verify key storage in S3
  - [ ] Test Core's ability to use the key
  - [ ] Verify rate limiting through Core
  - [ ] Test key expiration through Core

### 2. Integration Testing

- [ ] Test end-to-end flow:
  - [ ] Core startup and ngrok URL registration
  - [ ] Gateway's dynamic URL updates
